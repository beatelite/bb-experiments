# Beaver Builder Experiments

This is a set of experiments and ideas to extend Beaver Builder. This code is free to use but is experimental and not supported in any way. Please do not use this plugin on a production site.

## Experiment 1: UI Color Schemes
This plugin adds "User Interface" tab to the Global Settings panel in page builder (Tools > Edit Global Settings). This tab allows you to select from multiple alternate color schemes for the Beaver Builder UI. You can also compose your own style using the custom option.
